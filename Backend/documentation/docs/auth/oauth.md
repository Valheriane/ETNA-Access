## Introduction to OAuth in API Authentication (Future Feature)

OAuth is a standardized authorization protocol that allows users to grant limited access to their resources without sharing their credentials. Unlike traditional authentication via email/password and JWT, OAuth enables a third-party application to access an API securely on behalf of the user.

At present, OAuth is not yet implemented in our authentication system. However, we plan to integrate it as a future feature to enhance security and user experience by allowing authentication via external identity providers such as Google, GitHub, or Microsoft.

## Differences Between OAuth and Email/Password-Based JWT Authentication

| Feature                | JWT (Email/Password)           | OAuth |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| Authentication Mode    | Based on stored user credentials | Based on an external identity provider |
| Security              | Can be compromised if credentials are stolen | Uses temporary tokens with scoped permissions |
| User Experience       | Users must sign up and remember passwords | Users can log in via external providers (Google, Facebook, etc.) |
| Permission Management | Defined internally within the app | Granular access control via OAuth scopes |

## How Will OAuth Work Once Implemented?

1. **User Initiates Login**:
   - The application redirects the user to an OAuth provider (e.g., Google, GitHub, Microsoft).

2. **Authentication with the Provider**:
   - The user enters their credentials on the provider’s login page and grants the requested permissions.

3. **Authorization Code Retrieval**:
   - The OAuth provider returns a temporary authorization code to the application.

4. **Token Exchange**:
   - The application sends this code to the provider to obtain an `access_token` and, optionally, a `refresh_token`.

5. **Accessing Protected Resources**:
   - The application uses the `access_token` to make authenticated requests to the API.

6. **Token Renewal**:
   - If the `access_token` expires, the application can use the `refresh_token` to request a new one without requiring the user to log in again.

## Example of Future OAuth Integration in the API

### Redirecting to an OAuth Provider
```python
@app.route("/oauth/login")
def oauth_login():
    google_auth_url = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=email profile"
    return redirect(google_auth_url)
```

### Exchanging the Authorization Code for an Access Token
```python
@app.route("/oauth/callback")
def oauth_callback():
    code = request.args.get("code")
    token_url = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
    data = {
        "client_id": "CLIENT_ID",
        "client_secret": "CLIENT_SECRET",
        "code": code,
        "grant_type": "authorization_code",
        "redirect_uri": "REDIRECT_URI"
    }
    response = requests.post(token_url, data=data)
    tokens = response.json()
    access_token = tokens.get("access_token")
    return jsonify({"access_token": access_token})
```

## When Should OAuth Be Used Instead of Classic JWT Authentication?

- **When users should be able to log in via external providers** (Google, GitHub, etc.).
- **When the application needs to interact with other APIs requiring OAuth** (e.g., accessing Google Drive, Microsoft Graph, etc.).
- **When reducing the need to store and manage passwords internally** is a priority.

## Future Considerations

While OAuth is not yet implemented in our authentication system, we are evaluating its integration based on the project's evolving needs. The goal is to provide a more secure and seamless authentication experience while ensuring compatibility with third-party services.

In the future, OAuth could be combined with JWT authentication—using OAuth for user authentication and JWT for internal API authorization.

## Conclusion

Integrating OAuth will enhance security and usability by delegating authentication to trusted providers. As we move forward, we will assess how best to implement it while maintaining flexibility and security for users. Stay tuned for further updates on this feature!
